# Collatz-Conjecture-

Did this to fun side project to get things off my mind , I tried it with the number 75,128,138,247 and it gave correct results. The time elapsed will always show zero as it completes the task in under 1ms.I haven't tried with higher digit numbers, will try to add some more lines of code as soon as I have time.
